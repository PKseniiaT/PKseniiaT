## Hi everyone 👋


I'm **Kseniia**, a **Systems Analyst**. My specialty is designing digital solutions at the intersection of business logic, data, and user experience.

Here's a bit about me:

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** extending the actor model for a fitness application. Beyond the trainer role, I'm now designing and documenting user scenarios for a new core entity — clients — to complete the system's end-to-end workflow.
- 🌱 **I’m deepening my knowledge in** API design (REST/SOAP), integration patterns (Event-Driven, Message Queue), and Agile methodologies (Scrum/Kanban).
- 👯 **I’m open to collaborating on** projects that require requirements analysis, interface prototyping, or integration design.
- 🤔 **I’m interested in discussing** business process modeling (BPMN), working in Agile environments, UI/UX design principles, and I'm incredibly eager to learn about the specifics of working in adjacent roles—from product management to DevOps.
- 💬 **Ask me about** translating a fitness tracker idea into detailed user stories, or how to choose an integration method between microservices.
